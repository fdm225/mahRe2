-- Changes/Additions:
-- 	Choose between using consumption sensor or voltage sensor to calculate
--		battery capacity remaining.
--	Choose between simple and detailed display.
--  Voice announcements of percentage remaining during active use.


-- Description
-- 	Reads an OpenTX global variable to determine battery capacity in mAh
--		The sensors used are configurable
-- 	Reads an battery consumption sensor and/or a voltage sensor to
--		estimate mAh and % battery capacity remaining
--		A consumption sensor is a calculated sensor based on a current
--			sensor and the time elapsed.
--			http://rcdiy.ca/calculated-sensor-consumption/
-- 	Displays remaining battery mAh and percent based on mAh used
-- 	Displays battery voltage and remaining percent based on volts
--  Displays details such as minumum voltage, maximum current, mAh used, # of cells
--	Switchs between simple and detailed display using a switch
--		Switch is optional and configurable, SF down by default
-- 	Write remaining battery mAh to a Tx global variable
-- 	Write remaining battery percent to a Tx global variable
-- 		Writes are optional, off by default
--	Announces percentage remaining every 10% change
--		Announcements are optional, off by default
-- Reserve Percentage
-- 	All values are calculated with reference to this reserve.
--	% Remaining = Estimated % Remaining - Reserve %
--	mAh Remaining = Calculated mAh Remaining - (Size mAh x Reserve %)
--	The reserve is configurable, 20% is the set default
-- 	The following is an example of what is dislayed at start up
-- 		800mAh remaining for a 1000mAh battery
--		80% remaining
--
-- 	Notes & Suggestions
-- 		The OpenTX global variables (GV) have a 1024 limit.
-- 		mAh values are stored in them as mAh/100
-- 		2800 mAh will be 28
-- 		800 mAh will be 8
--
-- 	 The GVs are global to that model, not between models.
-- 	 Standardize accross your models which GV will be used for battery
-- 		capacity. For each model you can set different battery capacities.
-- 	  E.g. If you use GV7 for battery capacity/size then
--					Cargo Plane GV7 = 27
--					Quad 250 has GV7 = 13
--
--	Use Special Functions and Switches to choose between different battery
--		capacities for the same model.
--	E.g.
--		SF1 SA-Up Adjust GV7 Value 10 ON
--		SF2 SA-Mid Adjust GV7 Value 20 ON
--	To play your own announcements replace the sound files provided or
--		turn off sounds
-- 	Use Logical Switches (L) and Special Functions (SF) to play your own sound tracks
-- 		E.g.
-- 			L11 - GV9 < 50
-- 			SF4 - L11 Play Value GV9 30s
-- 			SF5 - L11 Play Track #PrcntRm 30s
-- 				After the remaining battery capicity drops below 50% the percentage
-- 				remaining will be announced every 30 seconds.
-- 	L12 - GV9 < 10
-- 	SF3 - L12 Play Track batcrit
-- 				After the remaining battery capicity drops below 50% a battery
-- 				critical announcement will be made every 10 seconds.
